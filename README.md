# StudyApp
The goal for this app meant to help students in studying, by providing a place to create, keep, and study their study sets. In the end, ideally it will allow for a user to create study sets of 3 different basic types, among other feature (more detail in teh OnePager).

Currently, the user can enter and view a term-definition study set in the app. As this is still a work in progress, there is some issues with some those functions. The data will not yet persist between sessions of using the app.
