# StudyApp

The goal for this app meant to help students in studying, by providing a place to create, keep, and
study their study sets. In the end, ideally it will allow for a user to create study sets of 3
different basic types, among other feature (more detail in teh OnePager).

Currently, the user can enter, view, and edit a term-definition study set in the app. Currently,
there is no scrolling, or studying page. The data will not yet persist between sessions of using the
app.
