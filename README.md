# StudyApp

The goal for this app meant to help students in studying, by providing a place to create, keep, and study their study sets. In the end, ideally it will allow for a user to create study sets of 3 different basic types, among other features (more detail in the OnePager). The UI mock-up for it is in Figma, which can be accessed by this link: https://www.figma.com/file/pMUyj4ieTmEj3PNUsxeMJh/StudyAppUIMockup?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ijPoY29eLPMRl1rN-1.

Currently, the user can enter, view, edit, and study a term-definition study set in the app. The data will not yet persist between sessions of using the app.
